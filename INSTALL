Clone this repository in your torcs source repository at /src/drivers
for example:
cd /usr/src/torcs/torcs-1.3.7/src/drivers
git clone https://github.com/CANVAS-SOAR/soarbot.git

Set the following variables according to your torcs location
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
export TORCS_BASE=/usr/src/torcs/torcs-1.3.7
export MAKE_DEFAULT=$TORCS_BASE/MAKE-default.mk

The above commands may differ based on your specific installation,but they should be similar.

Consider placing the exports in your shell configuration file (e.g. ~/.bashrc) so that you won't have to export them for every new shell.

Lastly, install by running 'make' and 'make install' in the soarbot directory. Next time you run torcs, you should see a driver named 'soarbot'
